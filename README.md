# Random Forest Classifier Implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Random Forest Classifier using Python's `sklearn` library. The classifier is trained to predict labels based on the features provided in `traindataset`.

## Overview

The Random Forest Classifier is a versatile machine learning algorithm capable of performing both regression and classification tasks. It is also used for dimensionality reduction, treats missing values, outlier values, and other essential steps of data exploration, and does a fairly good job. It is a type of ensemble learning method, where a group of weak models combine to form a powerful model.

In this implementation, we use the `RandomForestClassifier` from `sklearn.ensemble`. The classifier is configured with 200 estimators and uses entropy as the criterion for measuring the quality of a split.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn

## Usage

To use this classifier, you need to have a dataset `traindataset` and a corresponding set of labels `train['Label']`. The dataset should be preprocessed and ready for training.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# implementing Random Forest Classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=200, criterion='entropy')
clf.fit(traindataset, train['Label'])
